# Spike-Triggered Construction Estimating STDP

These MATLAB files create and simulate spiking neuron models with spike-timing-dependent plasticity. The results of simulating neurons with STDP and simulations that use a spike-triggered constructive algorithm and estimates of STDP are compared. Figures are generated to view the results of simulations.

These simulations and figures were presented in the PhD thesis 'Constructive Spiking Neural Networks for Simulations of Neuroplasticity' by Toby Lightheart.

To run all simulations and generate figures open and run the file: run_all_STDP_STDC_fig.m

**NOTE:  
  (1) Directories and files are created to save simulation results. The space used by simulation results files is approximately 1GB.  
  (2) Simulations take approximately 2 hours on a quadcore i5-3720K @ 3.40GHz.  
  (3) Figures can be saved by editing 'save_all_figures_as_pdfs' and 'save_all_figures_as_figs' options in the 'run_all_STDP_STDC_fig.m' file. The .fig files store variables and take 411MB of memory.**
